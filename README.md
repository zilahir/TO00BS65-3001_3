## Introduction

This app implements a very simple `NodeJS` `API`. running on `ExpressJS`, and it's written in `TypeScript`. The `production` build of the application is deployed to `Heroku` and can be accessed via the following link laurea-api.herokuapp.com/](https://laurea-api.herokuapp.com/)

##¬†Local development

To run this application locally in development mode, you need to make sure you satisfy the following prerequisities:

* `node > 16`

```
‚ûú  ~ node - v
Welcome to Node.js v16.2.0
```

* `NPM > 7`

```
7.1.1
```

* `Docker > 20`

```
‚ûú  ~ docker -v
Docker version 20.10.6, build 370c289
```

1) clone this repo
2) `docker compose build`
3) `docker compose up -f docker-compose.dev-yml`

After the containers are up and running, you should see something like this on your `console`:

```

Now, the `MongoDB` port's should be exposed at the `27017` port, while the `API` itself on the `9009` port. For further information of the local docker envorinment, please refer to the compose implementation at [`docker-compose.dev.yml`](https://github.com/zilahir/TO00BS65-3001_3/blob/master/docker-compose.dev.yml), and the [`local.Dockerfile`](https://github.com/zilahir/TO00BS65-3001_3/blob/master/local.Dockerfile).

##¬†`GIT`

The project's `GIT` repository can be found [here](https://github.com/zilahir/TO00BS65-3001_3).

There are `GitHub` actions in place, can be found [here](https://github.com/zilahir/TO00BS65-3001_3/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml). More about these in the [deployment](#deployment) section of this document.

There's a very basic `branching` model introduced in this project, which basically contains two branches on the `HEAD`:

* `master`
* `release`

The `master` is reserved, for active development, while new releases are triggered via `Pull Requests` on the `release` branch.

## Implementation

### Stack

This `API` is written using the `TypeScript` superset on top of `Javascript` using `ES6` features, and `ExpressJS`.

The local development uses multiple `Docker` containers:

* `backend`, which builds the backend's source code
* `mongodb`, which contains a `MongoDB` instance

These two are composed with `docker compose`, and connected via a `network` bridge.

### Routes

The `API` has the following routes:

| route path             | method   | controler               | description                                                          |
|------------------------|----------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/api/book/add`        | `POST`   | `BookController.add`    | insert's a new `Book` document into the database                     |
| `api/book/all`         | `GET`    | `BookController.all`    | returns every `Book` document from the database                      |
| `/api/book/search`     | `GET`    | `BookController.search` | returns `[Book]` document(s) from the database                       |
| `/api/book/id/:bookId` | `GET`    | `BookController.get`    | returns the `Book` document from the database, by the given `bookId` |
| `/api/book/id/:bookId` | `DELETE` | `BookController.remove` | deletes the `Book` document from the database, by the given `bookId` |

The implementation of the `routes` uses the `middleware` approach given by `expressJS`, where the `routes` controllers are passed in an `Array`:

```javascript
const route: Route = api.use(path: String, ReadOnlyArray<RequestHandlerParams>)
```

All the `routes` for this `API` is implemented in [`src/routes.ts`](https://github.com/zilahir/TO00BS65-3001_3/blob/master/src/routes.ts).


### Database

The application uses `MongoDB` to store application data, using the well-known [`mongoose`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) interface.

There is a single `mongoose` `Schema` defined, which implements a `Book`:

```javascript
export interface IBook extends Document {
  name: string;
  author: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

The `schema` is defined at [`src/models/Book.ts`](https://github.com/zilahir/TO00BS65-3001_3/blob/master/src/models/Book.ts).

###¬†`Docker` (prod)

The `production` build also deployed using `Docker`. The setup however is slightly different than the `local` environment. The `API` is distributed via _multiple_ `Heroku` apps, becasue it seems that `Heroku` can't handle multiple images in a single application. Therefore the `MongoDB` runs in one `dyno`, and the backend itslef runs on a separete one. These are composed together via a different `network` bridge in the backen'd docker image.

##¬†Deployment

The application's deployment is automated using `GitHub` actions. The release process will be auto-triggered, once a `PR` is getting merged from `master` into `release` branch. The pricess will rebuild, and re-publush the docker images to `Heroku`, and re-starts all the `dynos`.

## Testing

The `API` can be easily tested using the foundamental way of `API` documentation, which is the `SwaggerUI`.

Every route has it's route defined in `Swagger` which not just document's but provides a playground to make every endpoint easy callable from their `UI`.

The `SwaggerUI` can be accessed via the (`/dev/api-docs `)[https://laurea-api.herokuapp.com/dev/api-docs/].
The `manifest` of the `apidoc` is defined in the [`openapi.json`](https://github.com/zilahir/TO00BS65-3001_3/blob/master/openapi.json) file.

Every request contains a `schema` which defines an `example` body (where needed), and can be executed as is. The response is also shown in the `UI`.

`POST`: `/api/book/add`

```
